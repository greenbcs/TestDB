                            <p style="text-align: left" align="left">　　<span lang="EN-US">Neutrinos are elementary particles in the Standard Model.There are three flavors of neutrinos, known as νe, νμand ντ . Theneutrino flavor states are superpositions of three masseigenstates (ν1, ν2 and ν3), which undergo quantum interferenceduring the traveling, causing neutrino flavorchanges. This phenomenon is known as neutrino oscillation or neutrino mixing.The amplitudes of oscillation are connected to themixing angles θ12, θ23 and θ13. The oscillation frequenciesare determined by the difference of squared neutrinomasses, Δm2ij = m2i-m2j.</span></p>
                            <p style="text-align: left" align="left">　　<span lang="EN-US">θ12 and Δm221 were measured by solar neutrino experiments and a reactor neutrino experiment KamLAND.θ23 and |<a style="color: #000000" name="OLE_LINK1">Δm232</a>| were measured by atmospheric and accelerator neutrino experiments. The last unknown mixing angle θ13 was determined to be unexpectedly large by the DayaBay Reactor Neutrino Experiment, as well as otherreactor neutrino experiments Double Chooz and RENO, and accelerator neutrino experiments T2K and MINOS. These measurements open a new era of neutrino experiments.The next generation neutrino oscillation experiments will focus on determining the sign of Δm232 (mass hierarchy), precisely measuring all oscillation parameters and searching for CP violation in the neutrino oscillation.</span></p>
                            <p style="text-align: left" align="left">　　<span lang="EN-US">The major goal of JUNO is determining neutrino mass hierarchy by precisely measuring the energy spectrum of reactor electron antineutrinos at a distanceof ~53 km from the reactors. A relative measurement technique was developed based on the interference of two different oscillation frequency components driven by Δm232 and Δm231, which can reach to a sensitivity of Δχ2&gt;16 in the idea case of single reactor and single detector, and Δχ2&gt;9 considering the spread of reactor cores and uncertainties of the detector response. If the absolute value of Δm2μμ(which is an approximation of Δm232) measured from acceleratorexperimentsis included with a precision of 1%, the sensitivity of mass hierarchy can be improved toΔχ2&gt;25 and Δχ2&gt;16 in the idea and real case, respectively.</span>&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US">　</span></p>

Considering the precision of sin2θ13 can be measured to ~4% by Daya Bay, the unitarity of the neutrino mixing matrix can be probed to 1% level.

There is no other nuclear power plant within 200 km. A 270 m high granite mountain provides good shielding of cosmic muons, which are the major sources of backgrounds. To further suppress muon induced backgrounds, the detector is designed to be located deep underground through a tunnel, and the total overburden will be 700 m rock. Experiment construction will start in 2014 and completein 2019, including a tunnel, an underground experiment hall, a water pool, a central detector, a muon tracking detector, and some
